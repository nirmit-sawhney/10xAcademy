-->SIGN NUM

A signum function returns 1 for numbers greater than zero and -1 for numbers less than zero and 0 for an 
input of 0. Write a signum implementation that takes a float N and returns an integer.

INPUT-> -0.87
OUTPUT-> -1

three cases
case 1-> num>0->positive number  return 1
case 2-> num<0->negative number  return -1
case 3-> num==0->num is zero     return 0


-->Difference of sum of Even Odd Index numbers

Write a function which takes a list of positive integers and returns the difference of sum of numbers
at even and odd index positions. Your function should take the list, sum all the numbers which are 
located at even index poistion of list and sum all the numbers which are located at odd index poistion
of list and subtract odd postion sum from even position sum.

INPUT-> [23,52,0,31,200]
OUTPUT-> 140 

23 52 0 31 200->array elements
0  1  2 3  4  ->array indexes

evensum-> sum of all elements present at even indexes 
evensum=0+23+0+200=223

oddsum-> sum of all elements present at odd indexes 
oddsum=0+52+31=83

res=evensum-oddsum=223-83=140

-->PRINT WITH INDEX 

You are given a function printWithIndex that takes a number and a string to print a message. 
You are also given a list that contains n strings. Write a function named printer that uses 
printWithIndex to print the list elements with their indices.

INPUT->
4
hello
cat
dog
raining

OUTPUT->
0 hello
1 cat
2 dog
3 raining 

["hello","cat","dog","raining"]
 0        1      2     3
0 hello
1 cat
2 dog
3 raining


-->STRING REPEAT

Write a function that takes in a string s and a positive integer n, and returns a replicated string r 
such that r is n times s with space in between.

INPUT->
abc
3

OUTPUT->
abc abc abc 

abcd 
5

abcd abcd abcd abcd abcd 

res=""
inputString=abc 
repeat=3
res=abc+" "+abc+" "+abc
res=abc abc abc
