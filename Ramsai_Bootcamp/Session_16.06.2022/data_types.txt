scripting language and programming language 
web applications 

->store data

types of data 
->Integer (0 1 2 67 -86)
->String "hi" "hello"
-> Boolean (true or false)
-> undefined 
-> Float (0.3 0.44 1.3)
->big integer

how to store data
-> variables
-> objects
-> arrays

keyword-> it is a reserved word in any programming langauge that is used for a specific purpose

we can't use variable name as keyword

to store data we have variables 

to initialize a variable we have some keywords
->var 
->let
->const

--> var va_lue=3   (= is assignment operator, we are assigning 3 to value)
--> var str="hi"

dynamic language(static language such as c++ or java, int ,string,boolean)

--> let x=4
--> let x=5 , str="hello"

CASE SENSITIVE LANGUAGE-> age Age AGE

diff bw let var and const 

var means the variable will have global scope 
let means the variable will have only scope inside that block
const means that the variable is constant and we can't reinitialize that

let val=3
val=10

const val=3
x (val=10)

print something
console.log()

let val=3
console.log(val)
3

-->operators(we can do mathematical operations)

+ operator

let x=3,y=6
let z=x+y
console.log(z) ->9

- opeator 
let z=x-y -> -3

* multiply operator 
let z=x*y -> 18

/ divide operator 
let z=y/x ->2

% modulus operator 
for finding remainders 
let z=y%x -> 0 (remainder)
