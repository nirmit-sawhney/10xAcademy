PROBLEM->
One day Professor Xavier saw alphabets appearing on the stars. He was so fascinated by them that he 
started making a list of numbers and for every new star, he inserted a number X into the list. This X 
is equal to the no. of times the alphabet on the current star has previously appeared.

After seeing N stars, he decided to stop and calculate the sum of all the N numbers.

Professor Xavier has spent all his life watching stars and do not know how to add. Can you help him in finding the sum?
