--> ADD STRINGS
Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2.
Note:
The length of both num1 and num2 is < 5100.
Both num1 and num2 contains only digits 0-9.
Both num1 and num2 does not contain any leading zero.
You MUST NOT convert the inputs to integer directly.
Complete the addStrings function. It takes the input as two strings & you need to return the string 
(which will same as the addition of two number as integers).

input- 22 111 =22111
output-133

 22
111

convert digit character to integer=c-'0'

'2'-'0'=2 + '1'-'0'=1= 3
let ans=""
ans=sum.toString()+ans
ans=3
ans=sum+ans==3+3=33

ans=33
sum=1
ans=sum+ans=1+33=133

sum=9+9=18
ans=8+ans carry=1
sum%10=currdigit
sum/10=carry

--> TREK 
You went on a trek with HEC(Himalayan Explorers' Club). The trek was to a very beautiful place known as 
Valley of Flowers'.
For each step you took on the trek, you noted it down as U for Upward and D as Downward.

--> LONGEST SUBSTRING
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

--> LONG PRESSED
Your friend is typing his name into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character c, the key might get 
long pressed, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the typed characters of the keyboard. Return True if it is possible that it was your friends
name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed. Else return False
